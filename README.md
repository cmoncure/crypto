Julia implementations of the Matasano Crypto challenges

After doing a couple of these in C, as much fun as it was to naively roll my own string types and linked list, I decided to start over in a more modern language.  I definitely miss a couple of features from Python for this kind of problem, particularly the well realized collections.  Looking at either C# or maybe Julia.  Maybe both.
